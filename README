## Setup and Development

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Code editor (VSCode, Sublime, etc.)

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Open the folder in your code editor
3. Use a local development server to preview the site:
   - With VSCode: Install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live"
   - With Python: Run `python -m http.server` in the project directory
   - With Node.js: Install `http-server` via npm and run it in the project directory

### Making Changes

- **HTML Structure**: Edit `index.html` to modify content and structure
- **Styling**: Modify `css/styles.css` for layout and design changes
- **Animations**: Edit `css/animations.css` and `js/animations.js` for animation behaviors
- **Functionality**: Update `js/main.js` for interactive features

## Animation Notes

The site uses scroll-based animations that reveal elements as the user scrolls down the page. Elements with the `.animate-on-scroll` class are initially hidden and revealed when they enter the viewport.

If animations aren't triggering properly, check the `initScrollAnimations()` function in `main.js` or add this code to force visibility:

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('.animate-on-scroll').forEach(function(element) {
    element.classList.add('visible');
});
```
